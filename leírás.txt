Learning2DEngine

Introduction:
This project was created for my own development and I want to use this one for reference too.
I have relearned the C++ and I have learned the OpenGL form https://learnopengl.com/.
But I think the "Game Engine Architecture" book and the Unity Engine also influenced me a lot.
I think the project's name is a bit tricky, because I guess it is only a library (yet).

Futhermore, I know, yes I know, lots of features are missing, some features could be better and why it is Visual Studio Project and not CMake.
Maybe one full life is not enough for a huge project like a Game Engine. But we have to accept it, that similar projects will never be completed, just finished.

Last and not least, the project's starting point was the Breakout, which is reimplemented in my Engine.
Maybe today, there is not any code line, which came from that project. But everything is start from here. (https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout)
The code owner is Joey de Vries, who has the https://learnopengl.com/ webpage too. Its license. (https://learnopengl.com/About)

So, if you want to try Learning2DEngine, you can do it. But you should check the licenses first. (Maybe the Engine and the games have separate lincenses).
Moreover, if I create a new version, maybe it won't be compatible with the older versions.

Requirements:
	Visual Studio 2022
	With "Desktop development with C++" Module
	
Used Libraries:
The most project can't really be started from zero, so I also use some library, but I tried to keep them minimum.
