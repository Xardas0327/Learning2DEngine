# Learning2DEngine

## Introduction:
This Game Engine was created for my own development and
I want to use this one for reference too.  
I have relearned the C++ and I have learned the OpenGL form
[learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/).  
But I think the Game Engine Architecture book, the Unity Engine and The Cherno also influenced me a lot.

I plan to continue its developing. But I think one full life is not enough
for a huge project like a Game Engine (mostly, if I can work on it only in my free time)
and we have to accept it, that similar projects will never be completed, just stopped
or restarted.

Last, but  not least, the project's starting point was the Breakout, which is reimplemented in my Engine.
Maybe today, there is not any code line, which came from that project.
But everything was started from [here](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout).  
The code owner is Joey de Vries, who has the
[learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) webpage too.
Its [License](https://learnopengl.com/code_viewer_gh.php?code=src/7.in_practice/3.2d_game/0.full_source/progress/2.program.cpp).

So, if you want to try Learning2DEngine, you can do it.
But you should check the licenses first. Their licences are in their own documentation.  
Moreover, if I create a new version, maybe it won't be compatible with the older versions.
