# Tiled Map Editor

The engine does not have its own editor.
That is why the [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) is supported.  
This user documentation will help, Tiled Map Editor's feature are supported
and which are not.  
If you are interested more about the code, it is [here](Learning2DEngine/Editor.md).  
Here the code sample will be minimal.
